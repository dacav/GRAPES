This directory contains a part of libdacav 0.9.0, which is used by the TCP
implementation of the net-helper (linked lists and hash tables are needed
by it).

libdacav is distributed under the terms of GPL version 3, however, as
author of the libdacav project, I'm ok with those parts to be distributed
as GPL version 2. This should allow the distribution with GRAPES, which is
GPL 2.
